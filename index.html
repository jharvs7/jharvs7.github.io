        <h2>Hackers have the ability to make or break games</h2>
        <p class="description">Hacking videogames like cheating in real life has both positives and negatives. It can make or break a person's playthrough of a game. Bad hacking ruins the players experience by putting them in unfair situations usually against other people on the game. Good hacking is used to make a game more fun by making new gamemodes, new maps or items, or even new features. This is best used in single player games. You can even make single player games multiplayer for a complete new experience. <a href="https://medium.com/@jakeh02/4a72d71179d2" target="_blank"> Here is a link to the post!</a></p>

        <h2>Social Media's Grasp on the Movie Industry</h2>
        <p class="description">When was the last time you watched a movie without first hearing about it on social media? Social media has completely taken over American life. The movie industry is no exception. It changed the way movies are made by breaking down barriers between the audience and actors while also giving marketing power back into the hands of the movie studios. In our first podcast "The Grasp of Social Media on the Movie Industry" the hosts of Luxrays The Podcast: Kyleigh Dawson, Sarai Alba, Jackson Lee, Al Kang, Jake Harville, and Prahaara Malli Sh will discuss their thoughts on this phenomenon. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-787894886/the-grasp-of-social-media-on-the-movie-industry?si=4dfafb1852984eff9397c871d2b8f04b&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing" target="_blank"> Here is a link to the podcast!</a></p>

        <h2>The Art of Competitive Pokemon</h2>
